      <body>
        Hi,

        Thanks for starting your 14-day trial on our platform. Below are some details so you can make better
        use of your trial:

        Our system has started to process the data you provided in order to match you with potential channel
        partners. Periodically, every couple of days, new connections will be added to your "My connections"
        tab.

        You can use these data to follow up with each channel partner based on your company's internal process
        or you can add them as opportunities in order to create a prospect pipeline with just one click.

        Once the trial ends you will receive a complete report with all your connections and activity on our
        platform.
