				<label id="3" text="In the old days, in some cases this is true even today, many vendors chose to manage their partner network with spreadsheets rather than using a software tool.

But with the explosion of SaaS tools there are now many solutions a vendor can select to manage, optimize and enable their partner network."/>

				<label id="34" text="Partner Training"/>
				<label id="35" text="Training your partners is essential for partner management, it guarantees that your branding and messaging stays consistent even in complex partner networks in which hundreds or even thousands sales reps and support people are involved. Most PRM systems will have a partner training module either native or as an integration with a third-party application but there also exist Learning Management Systems (LMS) that are focused in the channel."/>
				<label id="36" text="One such example is NetExam that offers an LMS system focused on training channel partners and can be integrated with most CRMs like Salesforce, Oracle and Microsoft Dynamics."/>
				<label id="37" text="Litmos from SAP is another company that although they offer an LMS product they also have a specialized solution for partner training and some great functionality that allows you to even charge your partners for the training courses."/>
				<label id="38" text="Integrations Management"/>
				<label id="39" text="Most SaaS applications offer various integration with third party providers that not only helps their end-customers to easily transfer data from one application to another but also makes it easier for their product to be adopted by channel partners that are interested to upsell their clientele. The logistics of having an integration ecosystem of partners though can make it difficult to manage different APIs, scale your connectors and showcase your partners."/>

				<label id="42" text="Partner networks are in essence ecosystems, sometimes simple and some other times very complex in a way that are involved different types of companies from various sectors using multiple applications to run their businesses. That makes it challenging to have transparency in the channel and align strategies towards customer acquisition."/>
				<label id="43" text="In the recent years many great applications have emerged to help vendors manage their partner programs and ecosystems more effectively.

				<label id="53" text="P2P Network"/>
				<label id="54" text="As we mentioned on a previous section there are hidden opportunities in a partner ecosystem between the vendor and its channel partners. The same is true between channel partners that can collaborate in joint efforts to win more deals. Partner-to-Partner networks enable channel partners to share and receive deals with other companies in their network. A typical example is a channel company that has a potential lead but no expertise in that industry so they create a one-off collaboration with another channel company that fulfils the criteria to win the customer."/>
				<label id="55" text="One such network is P2PGlobal that is open for many different types of channel partners. Also, our platform has a "/>

				<label id="1" text="How to manage channel partners"/>
				<label id="2" text="Having a healthy channel network is paramount for vendors that rely on channel partners to drive revenue, up to 30% of total revenue in most cases. Recruiting new partners is just the first step when it comes to implementing a partner program. Keeping your partners constantly engaged and active is very important to achieve a high ROI on the money spent to attract new partners."/>
				<label id="3" text="Furthermore, enabling channel partners in the form of incentives, rewards, proper program structure and commissions is equally important. In order to put all these efforts in place, &lt;b&gt;channel partner management applications&lt;/b&gt; have been introduced to help vendors manage their partner network while providing the necessary support to partners. Many vendors rely on CRM or spreadsheets to manage their network and below we provide some reasons why these are not good solutions."/>
				<label id="4" text="Managing channel partners using a CRM"/>
				<label id="5" text="Using CRM to manage customer information and communications is great and can increase productivity. But using is to manage channel partners is not a good idea, not only it doesn’t provide all the tools to increase engagement and partner activity but also it sends a message to the partner network that he right tools are not in place to enable them."/>
				<label id="6" text="A CRM can keep updated contact details of a partner network, send occasional product updates or newsletters via email and check deals that can be registered but it leaves out all the important tools for channel partners to boost their performance. For example, there is no content library that channel partners can use to have access to important sales and marketing material, no deal registration process, no training module available and no commission automation. We can keep going with capabilities that CRM systems lack when it comes to managing channel partners."/>
				<label id="7" text="Managing channel partners with spreadsheets"/>
				<label id="8" text="&lt;b&gt;Managing channel partners via spreadsheets&lt;/b&gt; is also a bad idea, it has all the cons of a CRM system in addition to not being able to send new updates. Also, there is always the risk of duplicate data or errors when someone is using a spreadsheet and entering manual data. Finally, it send a really bad message to the partner network in terms of the organization and the importance it assigns to its partners."/>

				<label id="1" text="How the channel partner recruitment process works"/>
				<label id="2" text="Creating and scaling a partner network can make the difference for many SaaS companies in their growth efforts or to penetrate certain markets. But the &lt;b&gt;channel partner recruitment process&lt;/b&gt; may be proved to be more complex and harder than many channel developers think."/>
				<label id="3" text="Starting from the basics, similar to targeting end-customers, you have to identify who the ideal partner is. To achieve this, there are some indicators to help you find what the ideal channel partner looks like. First, you have to consider the markets that you want to recruit your partners, even if your mission is to recruit partners globally you have to prioritize the countries or regions."/>
				<label id="4" text="Another good indicator is to reach out to channel partners that already sell products that your solution integrates with. These companies not only are already active and have a sales process established and a customer base but also it’s easier for these organizations to offer complementary products to upsell their customers. Also, targeting companies that sell on specific industries is a great indicator for your ideal partners. These companies operate in specific segments of the economy so they know how to add value to certain customers."/>
				<label id="5" text="The company size of the channel partner can play a role when it comes to committing resources to actively promote and sell your solution or cover the demand you have generated. Therefore, depending on your end-customers, if you are targeting small or mid-sized companies or enterprise level organizations, you have to take into account the size of your partners as well. Finally, after you have narrowed down you list you have to identify the right person to get in touch. In very small or small companies it is usually the CEO or the CTO that are taking these types of decisions when it comes to partnering. In larger businesses you may find a vendor management role who is your best option to discuss about a potential synergy."/>
				<label id="6" text="After you have identified the right company and person there are a couple of things you can do to start engaging with them. You can create an email sequence to start booking meetings with potential partners or get in touch via social platforms like LinkedIn. These platforms also work to build awareness by joining relevant groups, like ours at IT Channel Partners, but do not overdo it in promoting your partner program. There are also many channel partner events that you can attend to connect with people working in the channel and also explore new market trends."/>

				<label id="2" text="A few years ago, as channel partners, we came to realize how hard is to discover new products, get in touch with the respective company, reach an agreement and finally resell software products. Some months and an Alpha version later, we introduce our Beta version in order to make that process uninterrupted and optimal."/>
				<label id="3" text="To make this happen we combined the talent of our software developer, Vagelis and the experience on partnerships, Christos and Ilias.

Now you can recruit, onboard, manage and train your channel partners from a single solution."/>

As a channel company you can manage all your sales data, reporting, commissions, training and communications from a single point and connect all your team members in the same account for better visibility and performance."/>
