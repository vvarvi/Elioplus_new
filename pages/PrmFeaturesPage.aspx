                                        Why should you distribute leads to your channel partners? For two main reasons. Imagine that you are a US based software company and you have a potential client from Brazil. The best option for you in order to win this sale is to send this lead to a Brazilian reseller of yours. The potential clients will feel more secure if they can work with a local reseller and by distributing this lead you will have more possibilities to win the sale. Also, you are going to have satisfied resellers by helping them increase their sales through the leads that you provide.
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="text-base lg:text-body">
                                        Through our lead distribution feature every Vendor is able to send leads to their channel partners by submitting a form. First step is to select the reseller that you want to distribute the lead. Second step is to fill the information of the potential client and then you click save to send the lead to the selected channel partner. You can fill the information of the client manually or you can pull the data from your CRM. Forms can be customizable, which means that we can add the fields of your choice or the ones that are included in your CRM in case we integrate the two systems.

At the end the reseller will update the status of the closed lead as won or lost and you will get notified through email too. We can even add more status options of your choice.

                                        One other example of how P2P can work beneficial for your company is the collaboration between your resellers and other resellers from our network. Imagine a reseller outside your network that has a potential client interested in buying or using a solution like yours. This reseller will be able to submit a form with the details of the deal and according to criteria like type of solution and geographic location will be able to reach out to your resellers that fit these criteria. Your resellers will receive this deal inside their inbox that is located on the Messages tab of their dashboard on Elioplus and communicate in order to work together and win this client. The external reseller and your reseller will win by closing the deal and you will win by selling your solution.

                                        When you sign up on the Elioplus PRM visit the Tier Management option to create your tiers. As a first step select the criteria of Annual or Total revenue that the system has to calculate to assign your channel partners in the right tier. When you select the Annual Sales option then our system checks your partners last year’s sales to assign them to the relevant tier that you will create. If you select Total Revenue then your partners will be ranked into tiers based on their total revenues.
                                    </p>

                                        As a next step name your tiers, the commission percentage for each tier and the amount of sales as a threshold for each tier. You can add a new tier from the option Add New Tier or remove a tier so you can have unlimited tiers for your channel partners. You can edit these at any time in case you want to refresh your partner program or add new tiers to reflect your partner strategy.
                                    </p>

                                        After you have created your tiers a Permissions option will appear automatically. In this field you can choose the permissions you want to grant your partners for the Deal Registration and the Lead Distribution Functionality. You can give access to these features based on a partner’s performance so for example you can allow only your Diamond partners to have access on the Lead Distribution feature or any other combination. You will see here your newly created tiers so simply select a tier in order to provide access or deselect for the opposite action. You can edit these fields in the future if you change your strategy.

You can easily manage your commissions, incentivize your partners by providing resources and material to higher performing partners. Finally, you can create gamification mechanism by letting your partners know their goals to upgrade to higher tiers.

You can also retrieve and deal from your CRM to distribute it to a specific channel partner by simply selecting the deal or using the deal’s contact email. In this way not only do you save time but also reduce errors when you input data that are already available in your CRM application.

                                        The process of connecting your CRM system is very easy and straight forward. You find your CRM vendor in the Integrations page and add your API key or any relevant information depending on the application you use. After you have added your credentials our system syncs with your CRM and retrieves the fields that you use on your Deals, Opportunity section or the corresponding name that your vendor is using. Elioplus PRM is replicating all the fields so your channel partners have to input all the relevant data when they register a deal. If you make any changes to these fields in the future simply visit your Integrations page and use the re-sync option to update your form.

                                        Amount: The total sales amount of a specific deal. In most CRM systems the amount is added in the currency the vendor uses so your channel partners will have to input that value, although depending on your CRM and edition in some cases your channel partners can add the amount in their local currency and your CRM will use the current exchange rate to view the amount in your preferred currency.
